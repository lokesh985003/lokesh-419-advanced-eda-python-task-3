# 🚀 Advance (EDA) Python Programming – Programming Task 3

## Innomatics Research Labs – Data Science Internship

This repository contains solutions to five Python programming problems completed as part of the **Advance (EDA) Python Programming – Task 3**.  
These problems focus on **algorithmic thinking, loops, counting logic, comparisons, and bitwise operations**, commonly seen in LeetCode-style challenges.  
All solutions are implemented using clean logic and structured Python code.

## 🧾 Problem Descriptions

### 1️⃣ Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array — `1_maximum_product_two_elements.py`

This program finds the maximum product of two elements after subtracting 1 from each element.

Purpose:
- Practice array handling and maximum value logic
- Improve understanding of comparisons and arithmetic operations

---

### 2️⃣ Count Number of Teams — `2_count_number_of_teams.py`

This program counts the number of valid teams that can be formed based on given rating rules.

Purpose:
- Strengthen nested loop logic
- Understand comparison-based counting techniques

---

### 3️⃣ Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time — `3_students_doing_homework.py`

This program counts how many students are doing homework at a specific time.

Purpose:
- Practice list traversal
- Apply conditional logic on time ranges

---

### 4️⃣ Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero — `4_steps_to_reduce_to_zero.py`

This program calculates how many steps are required to reduce a number to zero.

Rules:
- If the number is even, divide it by 2
- If the number is odd, subtract 1

Purpose:
- Improve loop control and conditional decision-making

---

### 5️⃣ Counting Bits — `5_counting_bits.py`

This program counts the number of 1s (set bits) in the binary representation of numbers from 0 to n.

Purpose:
- Understand binary representation
- Practice bitwise and looping logic
